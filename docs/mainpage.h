Kochol game engine is an easy to use game engine but it is in early releases.
It is written in C++ with good OO and the design is very flexible.
It uses Direct3D 9 and OpenGL and can be run on Windows and Linux.
KGE is open source and you can customize it with your need.

This is a documention which describes most of the classes and functions if you need more info

We want to learn game programming with developing this engine so we read the books and
online resources to make an advanced game engine.
