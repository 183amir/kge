KGE is designed to work on several systems.

# Requirements
SDL2-2.0 http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php 


# Installation
## Linux
these are the steps that I took to install KGE on a 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10 installation
	cd ~/git
	git clone https://github.com/kochol/kge.git
	cd kge
# I installed SDL2 with help from here
#	http://askubuntu.com/a/344528/66689
	sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
	sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
# commented the SDL lines in wscript
#	./waf configure build  --> this did not seem to work!
So I configured the code blokcs project to build with sdl and 
used a tool to export a makefile for project.
# install Cg toolkit from here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit
